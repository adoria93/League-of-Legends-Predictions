# League-of-Legends-Predictions

League of Legends is a popular online team based game where the objective is to destroy the structure in the center of the enemy team's base. To do this, players must battle in each of the map's three lanes, destroy towers and eliminate both player controlled units as well as AI-controlled units.

This project attempts to use data collected at the 10 minute mark for high ranked (Diamond) games in order to determine which of the in-game statistics are influential in determining if the Blue Team wins the game.

In order to accomplish this task, the data was used to create a logistic regression model. This model was then used to predict the outcome of a match using the statistics provided.

Provided is the .R file if you have R installed as well as a standard .txt if you would just like to view the code.
